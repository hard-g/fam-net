# FAM-NET

A child theme of Divi. An overview this theme's parts:

* `style.css` is a necessary part of any WordPress theme. This stylesheet has the header info (theme name, etc) that WordPress needs to list the theme on Dashboard > Themes. Custom styles could also be added here if you see fit.
* `functions.php` handles some of the theme setup, as well as the implementation of some WordPress hooks that are necessary to modify the way that WooCommerce works.
* `woocommerce/global/sidebar.php` helps us to load the proper sidebar for a given product category.
